# 👋 Hi, I'm Guillermo

🎯 **Staff Data Analyst** with 5+ years of experience in high-growth startups, working end-to-end across the modern data stack — from raw ingestion to strategic insights delivery. Over the past five years, I’ve worked in high-growth SaaS environments where the culture prioritized outcomes over hours. I’ve supported leadership teams with product and commercial insights to shape go-to-market strategies, while also working closely with C-level on forecasting, financial planning, and investor reporting. Besides, over the past months I have focused on the engineering side of things, being able to set up entire data pipelines and developing a proficient understanding of tools like Google Cloud.

If you're building something data-driven — or thinking about how data can *really* help you grow — I'd love to hear from you.

### 📌 What You'll Find Here

This profile showcases different repositories containing several types of projects:
- pyne_poc: contains the process of building a cloud-native pipeline from scratch (API → BigQuery → dbt → Looker), automating the data ingestion and transforming the data while keeping best practices in version control, CI/CD, and testing for analytics.
- prophet: contains a daily forecast of any given company spend at a country level using historical transactional data. The focus is on selected European markets and leverages Facebook Prophet for time series forecasting.
- exodus: contains the code for the different steps of an unsupervised ML exercise (dataframe creating --> PCA --> Clustering (K Means).



### 🧰 What I Do

I like to think of myself as the **Data Swiss Army knife** of the teams. I feel comfortable building robust data pipelines, data modelling and consulting team leaders on the right metrics to look at.

I’ve built and owned production-grade workflows using:
- **dbt, Airflow, BigQuery, Looker**
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, Cloud Storage, Scheduler
- **CI/CD for analytics**: GitHub Actions, testing frameworks, automated validation
- Strong grounding in **data modeling, experimentation, and analytics frameworks**

### 🚀 How I Work

My biggest strength is **versatility**. I bridge the technical and business worlds by:
- Delivering clean, scalable pipelines that support rapid iteration
- Supporting C-level stakeholders with clear, decision-ready analysis
- Leading cross-functional projects across product, engineering, and ops

But above all, I’m **curious**. I’m driven by helping teams and customers build new things — not just by writing code, but by **applying the right technology to solve real problems**.
