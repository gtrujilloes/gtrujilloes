# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Guillermo

ðŸŽ¯ **Staff Data Analyst** with 5+ years of experience in high-growth startups, working end-to-end across the modern data stack â€” from raw ingestion to strategic insight.

---

### ðŸ§° What I Do

I'm a **Swiss Army knife of data** â€” just as comfortable building robust data pipelines in Python and SQL as I am advising execs on strategic metrics or helping product teams refine experiments.

Iâ€™ve built and owned production-grade workflows using:
- **dbt, Airflow, BigQuery, Looker**
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, Cloud Storage, Scheduler
- **CI/CD for analytics**: GitHub Actions, testing frameworks, automated validation
- Strong grounding in **data modeling, experimentation, and analytics frameworks**

---

### ðŸš€ How I Work

My biggest strength is **versatility**. I bridge the technical and business worlds by:
- Delivering clean, scalable pipelines that support rapid iteration
- Supporting C-level stakeholders with clear, decision-ready analysis
- Leading cross-functional projects across product, engineering, and ops

But above all, Iâ€™m **curious**. Iâ€™m driven by helping teams and customers build new things â€” not just by writing code, but by **applying the right technology to solve real problems**.

### ðŸ“Œ What You'll Find Here

This profile showcases projects where I've:
- Built cloud-native pipelines from scratch (API â†’ BigQuery â†’ dbt â†’ Looker)
- Automated data ingestion and transformation with minimal infrastructure
- Applied best practices in version control, CI/CD, and testing for analytics
